# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

Node.js presents the opportunity to run JavaScript for every tier of a web application: the client-tier, application-/business-tier, and the persistence tier. Node modules are effectively libraries that allow developers the ability to bring in extra functionality. Notable examples of such modules include: `http`, `express`, and `mongodb`.
