# Webpack

Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

Webpack core features:

- Bundles ES Modules, CommonJS, and AMD modules (even combined).

- Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).

- Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.

- Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.

- Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

## Minification

Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser - e.g. code comments and formatting, removing unused code, using shorter variable and function names, and so on.
