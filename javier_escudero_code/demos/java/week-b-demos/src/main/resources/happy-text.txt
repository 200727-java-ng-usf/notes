There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. From all of us here, I want to wish
you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind
first. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.
